    <p title="It is distantly related to the common sage">This is a yellow sage (Lantana camara). This is a very good plant because:</p>

    <p>• It is beautiful</p>
    <p>• It is smelly</p>
    <p>• It is easy to propagate from cuttings or even seed (do not eat the berries)</p>
    </ul>
    <p>However it is not very winter hardy and is considered an invasive weed in some parts of the world.</p>
